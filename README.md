# Perimeter Threat Hunting – Continuation

## Overview

After completing the Network Security Essentials lab, I continued practicing log analysis and threat hunting techniques focusing on identifying full attack chains.

## Key Focus Areas

- Reconnaissance detection using firewall logs
- Brute force detection via VPN authentication logs
- Lateral movement identification using SMB, RDP, and SSH
- Command and Control (C2) beaconing detection
- Data exfiltration indicators

## Investigation Techniques Used

- Log filtering using grep, awk, sort, and uniq
- Correlation between firewall, IDS, and VPN logs
- Identification of attacker patterns and persistence
- Detection of compromised internal hosts

## Skills Improved

- Threat hunting methodology
- Incident investigation workflow
- Log correlation techniques
- SOC analyst investigation mindset

## Next Steps

Continue advancing into:

- SIEM analysis (Splunk / Elastic)
- Advanced threat detection
- Endpoint detection and response (EDR)
- Real-world SOC investigation scenarios
